## Secutiry-context

A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container. Security context settings include:
* Discretionary Access Control: Permission to access an object, like a file, is based on user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). 
* Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux): Objects are assigned security labels.
* Running as privileged or unprivileged.
